My life, my "business", if you will, runs on and through Nextcloud, almost exclusively. It is a large part of my personal and professional productivity that I don't know what I'd do without it.

I host it on PikaPods which allows you to pay as you go, where you use the _top up_ method to keep your services running and you don't have to be a sysadmin to selfhost.
