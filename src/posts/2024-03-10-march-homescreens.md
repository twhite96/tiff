I am extremely depressed; there's a lot to it. I am fortunate to not be as depressed as I was a couple weeks ago[^1]. But there is still so much turmoil in my life that I decided to nix the black homescreen and brighten it up.

I may go with a brighter color *still* because life is hard. Really hard right now.
