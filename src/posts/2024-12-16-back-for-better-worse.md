Used Neovim to write this post and accidentally closed the pane in Zellij which means I lost the whole fucking document.

So, long story short:

- I lived in a shoebox, a filthy, stinky, smoky shoebox
- I was spiraling mentally which meant I did not take care of myself, constantly spiraling between wanting to suck on a pistol, and literally banging my head against the wall. That is not hyperbole; I'd bang my head against the wall, or ball up my fists and hit myself in the cranium. I was not well.
- The sent me to a high tech hospital to get better and to find a place to live as my roommates son came home and I had to leave and it was definitely the right move for both of us.
- I found a company that rents to folks needing to get back on their feet. I have a pretty large judgement against me after losing my job and being without income for five months and these folks looked past all of that and let me rent this motel room outside of the city.

I am staying in a really quiet, clean, well-lighted place, and I am lost.
