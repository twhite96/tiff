## An Eleventy starter

Built around a CSS workflow that emphasizes guiding browser styling rather than micromanaging it. It incorporates progressive enhancement, fluid type and spacing, and utilizes modern CSS features for layout. The goal is to develop frontends that provide a great experience across all devices, connection speeds, and usage contexts.

**This is version 3.**
I keep a [branch of v1](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/tree/v1) and [v2](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent/tree/v2) because I have changed a lot of things.
I have tried to [document](/get-started/#docs-lol) most features and methodologies.

**Have fun** and let me know if you find any issues or have ideas for improvements!
