**UPDATE**

I am *not* moving. I was denied for poor folks housing because despite the fact that poor folks often are poor and practically homeless because **THEY FUCKING LOST THEIR JOB AND COULDN'T PAY THE ENORMOUS RENT BECAUSE THEY HAD NO INCOME** that shit doesn't matter. It just doesn't.

I swear to god if people didn't actually know me you'd expect my entire life to be fake, a farce, because there's just so much fucking *tragedy*.

Suckin on a pistol sounds nice, but I cannot, which stinks.

So I stay at the computer building my home lab and staying out of my head because if I sit still for any one moment I will lose my shit.




>  I lost it. like literally lost it. I screamed shook, hyperventilated, I was just sitting here grunting and non-verbal for a half hour. I had never experience that level of despair in my life and you and I know all the hell I’ve been through. That was primal and something I hope never happens again.

> For a whole hour all I could see was me in a noose or me sucking on a pistol. I hate everything about everything right now, the anger is beginning to swell, so the only thing I can think of doing is working on my resume and working on my homelab because otherwise it’s a death spiral into rage

That's where I'm at. Unless I get a job I am fucked.
