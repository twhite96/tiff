{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2024-05-25-knives/full-roster.jpg", "Cartographer's mat full of EDC knives", "Full current slate of knives. From left to right: Gerber Paraframe II, SOG Twitch II, DeWALT CL Pocket Knife, Kershaw Helitack, CIVIVI Voltaic" %}
{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2024-05-25-knives/gerber-paraframe-ii.jpg", "Gerber Paraframe II opened to full length", "My first ever 'proper' knife bought back in 2019. I thought this was the epitome of *classy* knives. In hindsight it's a terrible knife- you can not flick it open properly with the thumbstuds, it's just too stiff and the intent to fold the knife is set in too far so one handed folding is impossible." %}
{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2024-05-25-knives/g-paraframe-dewalt-comp.jpg", "Gerber Paraframe II and a DeWALT Pocket Knife opened to full length", "The DeWALT and Gerber fully opened to compare the length of similarly priced knives. The DeWALT is a much better knife, though I wouldn't call it an EDC knife." %}
{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2024-05-25-knives/g-paraframe-sog-comp.jpg", "The Paraframe II against the little SOG Twitch II", "The SOG Twitch is an itty bitty knife and I've got spider hands so this isn't an everyday carry for me, it's a drawer knife." %}
{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2024-05-25-knives/kershaw-closed.jpg", "Image of the Kershaw Helitack flipper switch knife", "The Kershaw Helitack is a flipper switch knife. There's a little tab up top you can flip the knife open with the flick of your index finger. This knife feels premium even though it is considered (and priced, apparently), a budget knife." %}
{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2024-05-25-knives/civivi-open.jpg", "Picture of a Civivi Stonewashed Knife with inlaid wood", "This CIVIVI Voltaic is absolutely *stunning*. Not only that, the deployment is much easier than anything else I have, so is the the folding back of the blade. It is comparable in price to the Kershaw but is much smoother and infinitely more attractive, at least to me." %}
