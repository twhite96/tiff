I don't necessarily wanna get into all the terrible shit I've done in the name of survival, jealousy, or to feel less vulnerable, but today, I had to throw these on.

Because it may seem because someone is chronically mental ill they are stupid and need to be babied but I'mma tell y'all right now: I'm not *that* kind of crazy. Trust. But I used to be.

Some of the best wordplay he's ever created was on this album.

This was, is still, Jay's best album. Should've just took a bow and left it at that and he's have been top 3. And Kanye's[^1] beat and production on this track just goes to show you how good a producer he was.

## The fakes and the OGs

Jay was *actually* a nigga from the streets and did *a lot* of shit. Now he's a billionaire so I guess he truly *is* the black Warren Buffett. I won't talk about the whole faux Black Excellence™️ by participating in late stage capitalism in the guise of Black Empowerment™️.

*Anywayyyyyy*... his best album with Reasonable Doubt a distant second.

[^1]: I know. He hadn't lost his mind yet.
