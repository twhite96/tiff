My uncle, friend, and I rescued the necessary stuff from my storage unit and now everything I own is in this room, where over $30,000 of stuff I owned has been auctioned off at the storage unit I rented that I can no longer afford.

I grabbed all of my main tech stuff plus my OLED TV which is over at my uncle's room.

I am currently deciding whether to write about my next endeavor but in the meantime here is how I'm arranging the room:

Needs a bit of organizing and cleanup but [it's halfway there](https://youtu.be/lDK9QqIzhwk?si=4vqA3nGfAJirX7yh&t=93)." %}

This is the backdrop I am working on beside my bed. Trying to decide where I should put these framed posters.
