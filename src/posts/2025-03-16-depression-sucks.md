Hey there brain, thanks for playing. You know it would be helpful if just for once you could stop misfiring the neurons. It's a complex system up there, no doubt, but I just want like a whole month of _peace_.

Depression sucks, it's bad, and you should feel bad for making me feel it.

Would just like a quiet mind.
