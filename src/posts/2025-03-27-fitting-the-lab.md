excerpt: Moving to Linux in the near future.

In his post [migrating from the Apple ecosystem](https://beardystarstuff.net/posts/2025-02-19.html) Bearded Guy talked about the recent cowardice shown by Apple, a platform he's used since 1993, cowtowing to the current regime in the White House. As someone who does not have the luxury of being a cis white man, or white _at all_, the current state of affairs is terrifying me.

Having Apple, a company I at once admired and bought thousands of dollars worth of hardware once I was able to afford to do so, be _this brazen_ about supporting fascists will never sit right with me.

The charade about privacy and human rights, looking back now,_disgusts me_ because I believed them. They were the good guys in a sea of corporate evil.

I should have known better. Corpos gonna corpo, capitalists gonna horde capital, grifters gonna grift. It's a tale as old as time. If there is money to be made and suckers who will pay you for your snake oil, unscrupulous people will do whatever it takes to extract capital from you. That's how it works.

I am not only forced to do this because of my finances; I wouldn't buy another Mac even if I had the money to. There are extremely capable alternatives on Linux, and I've been downloading them.

And, I have to say, Linux is _fun_. Some of the apps may not _delight_ but they are functional and _fun_. That's how computing should make a user feel- happy. And Linux makes me feel happy.

## My distros of choice

Arch, btw. And an Arch fork CachyOS for the very old laptop.

## The lab is coming along as well

Take a peak.

Video of the space, with trash that needs to be taken out, tut tut:
