A lot of times I am just looking to stop the anxiety from absolutely crushing me and seeing a gazillion tasks on my homescreen makes me want to crawl out of my skin.

This means at different parts of the day and/or week I have a Focus Mode come on automatically so that I can relax. Other times I just flip a Focus Mode switch and settle in for a weekend or chill night time gameing session.

## The homescreens

This is self-explanatory; I usually have this switch on during the weekends, when I am tired and just want to turn off my brain. Same with the *Gaming* Focus Mode homescreen:

Widgetsmith is an easy purchase for this kind of thing and I use it extensively when creating Focus Mode homescreens.

### Side projects

Whenever I am working on content for a side project, I grab the *Content* homescreen. It usually kicks off on the weekends starting Friday evening and then again on Saturday evening as well.

## Nighttime 

This is the homescreen I use at night; very few distractions and hope for a better day tomorrow.
