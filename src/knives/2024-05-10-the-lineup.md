    caption: "My first ever 'proper' knife bought back in 2019. I thought this was the epitome of *classy* knives. In hindsight it's a terrible knife- you can not flick it open properly with the thumbstuds, it's just too stiff and the intent to fold the knife is set in too far so one handed folding is impossible."
