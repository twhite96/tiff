## Corporations are not to be loved

As I said to a friend tonight:

> I have so much angst and so much to say and yet no one is here to listen. I feel like I am becoming a bit radicalized watching all of this, realizing that at the end of the day the people who employ you, the companies you like, don’t give a single fuck about you and they would drive over your corpse after pissing on it for 15 minutes if it means a 1% increase in share price.

Corporations are not people. They are here to suck every last bit of capital from every entity and person on earth.

I have *no* allegiance to any one company, and I *loved* Apple.

Keep the fucks. It's not [like there's](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/06/is-big-tech-now-just-too-big-to-stomach) a [tide turning against Big Tech](https://archive.ph/3BlJC) [or anything](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240207-big-tech-layoffs-perks-cuts)... 🤷🏽‍♀️
