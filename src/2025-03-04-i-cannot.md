Everyday is a struggle and the fascism continues to creep into democracies across the globe.

My life has gotten so tiresome that the level in CoD where you're in Burger Town in some suburb and it is dark as hell as the country is expecting a nuke to go off.

I imagine myself in that situation, in the middle of the road, screaming, "YES! Ha ha YES!" like the Sicko from Sickos Committee. I fear nothing anymore. But I'm tired.

Like sometimes I just would rather not wake up. And when I do and I open my computer I am reminded I should have stayed in bed, or at least never called the ambulance in 2004 and stayed asleep forever.
