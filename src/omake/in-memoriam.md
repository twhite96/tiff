- Wes, You were such a handsome fellow, my young self crushing on you hard. Then one day at the dance we always had every last Monday of the month, they said you weren't gonna be coming back. The lights went down, last spin, and they played Three Dog Night's *Mama Told Me Not to Come*. Sometimes I envy your courage. I will never forget your black, wavy hair, big glasses, wry smile, and kind eyes. 1999
