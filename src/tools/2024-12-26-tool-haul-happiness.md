For the first post on this collection, let's start with the basics of my loadout. Then we can work with reviews and things afterward.

## Photos of the loadout

{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2025-01-09-tools/m18.jpg", "width=400", "My first Milwaukee tool after being all in on the Mustard Brand (Dewalt). Gotta say I really like this." %}

{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2025-01-09-tools/veto-1.jpg", "width=400", "Monkey see, monkey do and so when I had the capital I picked up this Veto Pro Pac XXL. All the technicians rave about it and of course, I felt like I should have one. That's how Influencers work. Plus it's a really cool bag." %}

{% eleventyImage "./src/assets/images/gallery/2025-01-09-tools/tools-1.jpeg", "width=400", "Power tools for the most part, some Dewalt, some Ryobi, a no-name multimeter, etc." %}
